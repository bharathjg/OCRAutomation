# OCRAutomation
This repository stores the files used to run the document verification script.

The script was designed to automate document verification. This was a manual process that required clicking on a link for each entry, visually verifying the image and marking it off.
This was a tedious task considering the team dealt with over 4000 files at one point. Finding duplicates was also difficult.

This script solves both. It uses image processing and OCR checks for document verification and a function that checks for duplicates.

Might not be the cleanest code but it works well. Just a consequence of trying to work with poorly compiled real world datasets.
